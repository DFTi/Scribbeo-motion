## Scribbeo (RubyMotion)

This project has no user interface.

### Data-centric approach

The goal is to produce an application that ignores the UI completely in order to force the programmer to develop all expected functionality in the backend.

Once this is complete, theoretically you can implement any UI to take advantage of the functional classes.

### Testing

At first we're only writing unit and functional tests to verify the expected behavior of the units like MediaSource, MediaAsset, and so on.

Later, we will continue with interface tests, but that is not the goal right now as there is no interface in this project.
